These projects are NOT intended to be compiled into assemblies. The files are put into 
Visual Studio projects for organizational purposes only. The code within is
meant to be deployed as code files into the target project that can be configured
after the fact.
This code will almost certainly need to be edited by the end developer to configure 
other aspects of the application, so compiling it into assemblies defeats its purpose.

The purpose is to configure the dependency injection container for the entire application,
not just MvcSiteMapProvider. We are using a composition root pattern, which requires the
code to be as close to the entry point of the application as possible.

The general idea is that we want the host application to provide the dependencies for 
MvcSiteMapProvider and all other classes rather than allow the classes to provide their 
own dependencies.
