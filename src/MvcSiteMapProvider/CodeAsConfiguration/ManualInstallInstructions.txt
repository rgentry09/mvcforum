Follow these steps to manually install an external Dependency Injection container
into your project.

1. Copy the contents of the desired dependency injection container project into
your MVC application in the exact same directories.

2. Copy the contents of the Shared project into the exact same directories 
in your MVC application. Do not copy the DIConfig.cs file from this project.

3. Add any missing dependencies to your MVC application using the 
dependency injection project for your desired container here as a guide.

4. If you need to use IDependencyResolver, add "DependencyResolver" 
(without the quotes) as a conditional compilation constant
to your MVC project. This can be done by going to the Build tab under 
project Properties, and adding the value to the end of the list. 
These symbols should be separated by a semicolon (;). 
If you are getting runtime errors, you should try this setting.

Alternatively, you can edit the App_Start/DIConfigBootstrapper.cs file 
to achieve the same result.
