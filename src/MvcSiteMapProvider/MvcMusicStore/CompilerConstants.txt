The following compiler constants are supported for switching between
implementations. Note that while changing the constants affects compilation
immediately, changes to referenced files do not show up in the IDE until you
unload and reload the project file.

Right click MvcMusicStore > Unload Project, right click again, Reload Project.

In each of the following groups, no more than 1 constant should be entered at a time.
However, you can combine constants from multiple groups at the same time.
